                  A large part of customer relationship management is
                  determining a metric for success. Forecasting lets you create
                  a benchmark by which you can determine whether your results
                  are actually on par with your efforts. You can also use this
                  data to determine where you need to direct future efforts.

                  security breaches. This allows you to manage your employee’s
                  activity based on level and keeps your customer’s data safe.
