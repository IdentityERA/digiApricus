            <p className="left-text">
              Security Advisory dedicates itself to the vision that both users
              and information are central to today’s security. Organizations
              interact with many parties, not in the least their internal user
              groups: they provide services to users, cooperate with users,
              provide access to information to users, while users manage their
              systems and users also collaborate with other users. <br />
              The information a user needs or produces is equally pivotal. It is
              not about data. It is about data in context. Bringing context to
              data adds value for the user, converting it into information.
              Being able to manage and control the wealth of information in
              today’s technological landscape is a challenge. An issue of
              security needs to be addressed. A host of widely different
              solutions exist, selecting the best fitting one is therefore
              challenging to many organizations. In the view of digi apricus,
              such a predicament mostly stems from the fact that organizations
              traditionally only looked at the perimeter, as in the Jericho
              security model. Raising a proverbial wall for organizations to
              feel safe behind has triggered a mentality of letting your guard
              down. Security is no longer primarily about firewalls, IPS, and
              other archaic perimeter chokepoints. More than ever, it revolves
              around protecting the information and selectively allowing access
              to information from users and systems. The current security
              reality demands a top-down directive approach. Such an approach in
              organizations offers gains by illuminating which data matter in
              what context, specified by the user. Future-oriented organizations
              are those that think about the future of access. Security policies
              should be informed by the business. Translating the policy into IT
              and IT management follows that business logic. Following that,
              solutions are brought to bear. At the end of this sequence,
              network security measures have a place.
              <br />
              <br />
              Information security is complex and its challenges are growing.
              The hyper-connected world presents unprecedented opportunities of
              nonstop connectivity blurring boundaries between life and work,
              while successful monitoring and management of information seem
              elusive yet within reach. Taking control of governance solutions
              meets these challenges to create a secure and permanent future
              focus. <br />
              <br />
              Digi apricus Security Advisory offers guidance on the path to
              answer this forward-looking reality.

                  An Identity and Access Governance (IGA) solution give the
                  organization control over who has access to which data. A
                  situation that is common is that it is not recognized that
                  logic is needed for the structured management of information
                  and systems. There is no translation of the policy into
                  operational processes and no framework within which
                  standardization is possible. This access issue generally
                  provides the most findings in an audit. In the short term,
                  employees experience a lot of convenience in assigning access,
                  but in the long term, there is a proliferation of permissions
                  that can damage the business. IGA is therefore a combination
                  of internal control mechanisms that mitigates the risks of
                  unauthorized access and provides progress in compliance.

                <p>
                  A real chief information security officer, or CISO, is a
                  professional who works routinely with organizations to provide
                  all of the essential cyber security support one would expect
                  from an in-house senior executive within a more efficient and
                  affordable service model. Gain day-to-day cyber security
                  support and counsel from a dedicated CISO along with long-term
                  security strategy, vision, program and policy design, and
                  implementation.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  EaaS CISOs conduct a comprehensive assessment of a company’s
                  security posture to pinpoint weaknesses and optimize their
                  security standing over the long term. Acting either as a
                  long-standing resource for your team or as interim CISO, a
                  CISO will step in to establish security standards, implement
                  controls, and respond rapidly to incidents—continually
                  refining your approach to address the dynamic threat landscape

              <p>
                A CISO is your security point-of-contact for all
                security-related issues, offering a direct line to experts as
                questions naturally arise. An EaaS CISO will also respond to
                incidents, answer security-related questionnaires for your
                customers, and respond to a data breach should that arise. In
                addition to ongoing and ad hoc support, a CISO will tie into
                meetings when security expertise and guidance are needed.
                Additional CISO support includes:

                  Every business faces its own set of challenges, from rules and
                  regulations to highly sophisticated data security threats. And
                  regardless of company size, one-on-one counsel from a
                  dedicated cyber security engineer is often essential to keep
                  pace. Still short of hiring a CTO, it can be challenging to
                  pinpoint hidden vulnerabilities, draft the right action plan,
                  or choose the best technologies for your environment to
                  safeguard data assets and comply with new laws—particularly
                  within our fast-paced and ever-adapting threat landscape.{" "}

                    Too often, organizations take a narrow, reactive approach to
                    cyber security. But we work with companies to help them
                    block hackers proactively, pointing you to small and often
                    overlooked gaps that might allow intruders into your systems
                    to access highly sensitive data—leading to significant

                    Why should you conduct a penetration test?

                  <p>
                    Even with the strongest security and safeguards in place,
                    vulnerabilities exist and open your company to unknown risk.
                    Those gaps might be as unsuspecting as a database, an
                    application, website access—even your own employees. And any
                    of those access points could provide a direct route into
                    confidential electronic data, such as financials, patient
                    information, strategic or classified documents.
                    <br />
                    Pentest services delve deeper to pinpoint pathways to
                    access, ranking the potential value of each and providing a
                    clear roadmap for remediation. A penetration test is not
                    only smart business practice but also an annual requirement
                    for those who must remain in compliance with leading
                    regulations like PCI, FERPA, HITECH, FISMA, SOX, GLBA,
                    FACTA, and GDPR.

              <p>
                We begin with a simple question: what’s the least probable
                access point a criminal might use to gather intelligence that
                provides the greatest potential impact on your bottom line? From
                this question, we outline possible targets of attack and entry
                points via electronic, physical, and human means. This includes
                information your own employees might publish in the public
                domain, weaknesses in email passwords or log ins, remote access,
                and mobile footprints. We then perform reconnaissance over the
                span of several days to assess potential vulnerabilities from
                all angles.
                <br />
                Next, we put ourselves in your potential attackers’ shoes to
                determine overall risk and valuation. Based on what we know
                about current capabilities, strategies, techniques, and tools,
                we document any digital assets you might have at risk. We then
                prioritize that risk based on the net asset value were a loss
                event to occur.
                <br />
                <br />
                To put our findings to the test, we simulate ethical hacking
                attacks that are primarily focused on high value target assets.
                Those tests are customized to align with your unique
                environment, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Findings are
                prioritized and compiled into our recommendations to help you
                focus resources on areas that could mitigate the greatest
                potential loss.

                downtime, or indicate a serious security breach. But
                cybersecurity experts must then be at hand to promptly and
                individually analyze the sheer volume of alerts received.
                They’ll also need to correlate incidents and determine which of
                those might indicate a threat that’s malicious, significant, or
                part of a much larger and more serious attack.

                Gain access to leading technical solutions that we can put into
                place or let us work seamlessly with any next-generation
                anti-virus and firewall threat tool you prefer. Then let Cyber
                Security Services manage MDR including full-time threat hunting
                along with alert monitoring, prioritization, investigation,
                analysis, and response—24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
                year. We apply artificial intelligence models to server,
                endpoint, and network data, correlating and investigating
                indicators to determine scope and probable impact. We then
                report back to you with a root cause analysis and targeted

                Unlike Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)—which focus

                known threats along with firewalls, day-to-day network security,
                log management and monitoring—an MDR provider can pinpoint
                lateral movement, proactively detect advanced threats, monitor
                your network around the clock, conduct behavioural analysis, and
                advise on ways to strengthen your security strategy over time.

                and network intrusion with our unique layered approach to
                security. We monitor your network using real-time
                threat-intelligence feeds from the government and private
                sector, insights already in use by some of the most secure
                environments including the United States Department of Homeland
                Security. And we delve beyond 24x7 threat detection and security
                log monitoring to include security operations center (SOC)
                services and threat blocking by certified security analysts.
                <br />
                <br />
                While some services stop once they alert you, our security
                analysts investigate and prioritize threats to determine if
                action is even warranted. If it is, we then take action on your
                behalf, blocking in-progress incidents to minimize response time
                and damage potential while keeping you focused on core business
                functions.
                <br />
