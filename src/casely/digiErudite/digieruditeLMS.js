              How do learning management systems work?
            </p>
            <p>
              A learning management system can be thought of as a large
              repository that allows users to store and track information in one
              place. Any user with a secure login and password can access the
              system and its online learning resources. Or, if the system is
              self-hosted, the user must either install the software on their
              hard drive or access it through their company's server.

            <p>Some common features found in a successful LMS include:</p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Responsive design -</strong> Users should be able to
              access the LMS from whatever type of device they choose, whether
              it's a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone. The LMS should
              automatically display the version best suited for the user's
              chosen device. Additionally, the LMS should also allow users to
              download content so it is accessible while offline.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>User-friendly interface - </strong>The user interface (UI)
              should enable learners to easily navigate the LMS platform. The UI
              should also align with the abilities and goals of both the user
              and the organization. An unintuitive UI risks confusing or
              distracting users and will make the LMS ineffective.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Reports and analytics - </strong>This includes eLearning
              assessment tools. Instructors and administrators must be able to
              view and track their online training initiatives to determine if
              they are effective or need adjusting. This can be applied to
              groups of learners and individuals.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Course and catalog management - </strong>The LMS holds all
              the eLearning courses and the related course content. Admins and
              instructors should be able to create and manage these catalogs and
              courses in order to deliver a more targeted learning experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Content interoperability and integration - </strong>
              Content created and stored in an LMS must be packaged in
              accordance with interoperable standards, including SCORM and xAPI.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Support services - </strong>Different LMS vendors offer
              varying levels of support. Many provide online discussion boards
              where users can connect and help each other. Additional support
              services, such as a dedicated toll-free service number, are
              available for an extra cost.

            <p>
              <strong>Certification and compliance support - </strong>This
              feature is essential to systems used for online compliance
              training and certifications. Instructors and admins should be able
              to assess an individual's skill set and identify any gaps in their
              performance. This feature will also make it possible to use LMS
              records during an audit.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Social learning capabilities -</strong>Many LMSes have
              started including social media tools within their platform. This
              allows users to interact with their peers, collaborate and share
              their learning experiences.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Gamification -</strong>Some LMSes include game mechanics
              or built-in gamification features that allow instructors and
              admins to create courses with extra motivation and engagement.
              This can help students who need additional incentive to complete
              the course, possibly in the form of leaderboards, points and
              badges.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Automation -</strong>Learning management systems should
              enable administrators to automate repeated and tedious tasks.
              Examples include user grouping, new user population, user
              deactivation and group enrollments.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Localization -</strong>It is important for LMSes to
              include multilingual support features so the learning and training
              content can remain unaffected by language barriers. Some LMSes
              integrate geolocation features that allow them to automatically
              present the appropriate version of the course immediately upon
              access.

            <p>
              <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) - </strong>Finally,
              artificial intelligence can help an LMS create personalized
              learning experiences for users by providing course formats suited
              to their needs, and by suggesting topics the user may find
              interesting based on the courses they have already completed.

          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Cloud-based LMSes </strong>are hosted on the cloud and
              often follow a software as a service (SaaS) business model.
              Cloud-based LMS vendors take care of maintaining the system and
              performing any technical updates or upgrades. Online users can
              access the system from anywhere, at any time, using a username and
              password.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Self-hosted LMSes </strong>require software to be
              downloaded by the user. The self-hosted platform provides greater
              creative control and customization, but users must maintain the
              system themselves and often must pay for updates.
            </p>

          <div className="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Desktop application LMSes </strong>are installed on the
              user's desktop. However, the application may still be accessible
              on multiple devices.

              <strong>Mobile application LMSes </strong>support mobile learning
              and are accessible wherever and whenever through mobile devices.
              This platform deployment type allows users to engage with and
              track their online learning initiatives on the go.

                <strong>• Freemium - </strong>This pricing model allows users to
                access the basic features of some LMS platforms. Once users
                start engaging with the more advanced functionalities of the
                system, then a fee is added.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>• Subscription - </strong>Users pay a recurring fee at
                regular intervals in order to access the LMS. The subscription
                may grant an organization total access to all LMS features, or
                it may require the organization to pay for each system user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>• Licensing - </strong>This is either an annual fee that
                companies must renew or an upfront fee that provides users with
                unlimited lifetime access.

              Learning management systems provide users with a variety of
              benefits, regardless of the type of organization using it. For
              example, an LMS can save an organization time and money. Instead
              of making learners take time out of their day to travel and sit
              through lessons or training, LMSes allow users to complete the
              coursework at a time that is best for them. Additionally, costs
              can be cut by eliminating the need for instructors, training days,
              training materials, travel expenses and location hiring.

            <ul>
              <li>• the ability to monitor user progress and performance;</li>

              Finally, centralized learning is another major benefit provided by
              LMSes. It allows an organization to safely organize and store all
              big data in one location. This allows instructors and admins to
              more easily update and maintain learning materials. It also helps
              produce effective training that is consistent across the
              organization. Furthermore, most LMSes include advanced encryption
              features that help guarantee the data and content remain secure.
