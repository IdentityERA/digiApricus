              A learning management system (LMS) is a software application or
              web-based technology used to plan, implement and assess a specific
              learning process. It is used for eLearning practices and, in its
              most common form, consists of two elements: a server that performs
              the base functionality and a user interface that is operated by
              instructors, students, and administrators.

              Typically, a learning management system provides an instructor
              with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student
              participation, and assess student performance. A learning
              management system may also provide students with the ability to
              use interactive features such as threaded discussions, video
              conferencing, and discussion forums.

              LMSes are frequently used by businesses of all sizes, national
              government agencies, local governments, traditional educational
              institutions, and online/eLearning-based institutions. The systems
              can improve traditional educational methods, while also saving
              organizations time and money. An effective system will allow
              instructors and administrators to efficiently manage elements such
              as user registration, content, calendars, user access,
              communication, certifications, and notifications.

              The Advanced Distance Learning group, sponsored by the United
              States Department of Defense, has created a set of specifications
              called the Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) to
              encourage the standardization of learning management systems.
